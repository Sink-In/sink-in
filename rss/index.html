It&#x2019;s been a wonderful time. I did not grow just design-wise, but also at the personal level too. All thanks to <a href="https://medium.com/u/5e635919ea61">Yagnesh Ahir</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/1557faf381d3">Dhanashree Manohar</a>. Now, as I left the company, I would like to reflect on some of the non-design lessons learned.</p><p>When I was given the opportunity to join the team, I was so excited as I was getting a chance to work with the team of designers, the people who think like me, work like me, and understand what I work and also, can give me validations and feedback around what I was doing. But, I had not expected that I was not just going to learn only the design things like UX and UI, but a lot of other things that are parallelly important to designing solutions.</p><p>After joining, in a month, I realized that to design solutions and work in the design industry, you need to be good at more things than just knowing the UI and UX. So, in this blog, I am going to talk about skills that I learned along with designing the UI/UX at NextUX Design agency. And the reason why I wanted to share with you these lessons because, generally, when we start learning the UI/UX, we solely focus on learning the research and designing part, but there is actually a second part of designing solutions that we mostly ignore. But let me tell you, that second part is really going to make an impact on your design career and once you become good at it, you can be a really worthy designer.</p><p>So, let&#x2019;s start..</p><hr><h3 id="01-communication-is-power">01. Communication is power</h3><p>What you do every time, every day is not communication, it is talking. And there is a big difference between communication and talking. Especially, when you are doing it in the professional world, it is important how you communicate.</p><p>The reason I wanted to talk about the role of communication because as designers we are kind of the central point in the whole product development and customer feedback flow. We are going to work with developers, managers, decision-makers, end-users, and a lot more roles, and to make them understand your work, you need to be able to communicate well. And if we are not clear enough in your way of communicating things, then it is going to affect a lot of people in the whole flow. Our work as a designer is not just to design the interfaces or research problems, but also to communicate the meaning of that work. And if we are not communicating it well, then our work has no meaning.</p><p>This was something that I learned at the very initial days because this is the only way one can tell others what, how, and why you have done that thing.</p><h3 id="02-listening-is-an-underrated-skill-in-design">02. Listening is an underrated skill in design</h3><p>The second most important part of the design is, Feedback. Feedback is the thing for which you explore different ideas, design beautiful interfaces, and make a lot of other design efforts, and if you are not good at listening to what other people have to say about all those efforts, then you are going to miss a lot of good feedback.</p><p>Everyone thinks, they listen well. But, when you listen to feedback and go back to work, then you realize how much did you focus on the listening and what did you miss.</p><p>Especially, when you work in the client-based industry, your whole day is filled with calls, and most of the time, you are going to receive feedback over the calls. And I realized that it is very easy to listen when someone is speaking in front of you, but it is a lot harder to do it when someone is not present upfront. You will lose focus easily. And if you didn&#x2019;t listen to the feedback properly the first time, then you have to keep asking them again or you might miss designing some things. Without being a good listener, you are going to miss a lot of things. Listening requires deep focus.</p><p>And one more thing that I learned about listening is that, if you are a good listener, you can solve a lot of problems just by being in the conversation.</p><h3 id="03-second-order-thinking-a-skill-we-designers-should-master">03. Second-order thinking&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;a skill we designers should master</h3><blockquote>First-order<strong> thinking</strong> is the process of considering the intended and perhaps obvious implications of a business decision or policy change. <strong>Second-order thinking</strong> is the process of tracing down and unraveling the implications of those first-order impacts.</blockquote><p>I don&#x2019;t know how many of you have heard this skill, but this exists. And the people who are good at this are the people who top the chart in making good rational decisions.</p><p>I heard about this from <a href="https://medium.com/u/1557faf381d3">Dhanashree Manohar</a> and for the next few days, I was researching all about second-order thinking.</p><p>The reason why I started practicing this skill because whenever you are going to explore design solutions, the next thing will be to present your design or brainstorm with other people, and when doing that, you will be faced with a lot of cross-questions, and if you can&#x2019;t think about it and come back with an answer at the moment, then it will become very difficult for you to engage in a healthy and meaningful brainstorming discussion.</p><p>Most of the time, when someone asked me questions, I used to say them, I will get back to you in a couple of minutes. Sometimes, it is good that you are taking extra time to think, as you don&#x2019;t want to make a wrong decision. But doing it every time is just going to waste unnecessary time, not just yours, but also of your clients too. So, while presenting, and listening to the feedback, I always pushed my brain to think hard and see how that decision is going to impact in future.</p><p>Few people focus on this skill, but I realized if we improve and develop our second-order thinking then it is really going to have a large impact on our work style, and also, it will help us to think deeper than anyone else in the room.</p><blockquote>Good designers are paid for good thinking.</blockquote><h3 id="04-practice-presenting-your-work">04. Practice presenting your work</h3><p>My previous company was a product-based company. There was no client-side talking required for my profile. I just had to show and explain my work to the manager and the manager will have to take it forward. But, when I joined NextUX Design Agency, Presentations and walkthroughs were a regular thing. However, <a href="https://medium.com/u/5e635919ea61">Yagnesh Ahir</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/1557faf381d3">Dhanashree Manohar</a> were always there to start the conversation, but I had to take responsibility for my work. If I had done the work, I need to explain it to the client.</p><p>One thing which <a href="https://medium.com/u/5e635919ea61">Yagnesh Ahir</a> told me was if you want useful, actionable feedback, then you have to learn how to present your design.</p><p>The reason why you need to learn and practice presentation because when you are given a design problem, and you start creating the solution, you consider different ideas, constraints, and rationals, and if you don&#x2019;t communicate it well to others, then how are they going to understand why and what you have designed and if don&#x2019;t get it, how would they give you the feedback.</p><blockquote>A good presentation or walkthrough of work is not just important for you, but for others too, because they have to get back to you with effective feedback.</blockquote><p>Presenting work can be really fun and when you do it well, it&#x2019;s a great confidence builder. And a simple way to present well is to set the context before showing your design. Talk about the problem, how did you approach it. And then explain your approaches one by one. In the end, simply ask them, what do you think?. This is something that looks easy, but when you do it in real, you will miss a lot of points. I still practice this habit.</p><h3 id="05-make-priorities-your-friend-and-time-estimates-a-habit">05. Make priorities your friend. And time estimates a habit</h3><blockquote>One piece of advice to improve your productivity is to set priorities and time estimates.</blockquote><p>At the NextUX, two things that have improved my task completion efficiency are setting the priorities before the day starts, and estimating an approx time to complete the task.</p><p>When you are working on multiple projects and with multiple people, then you have to be clear enough on what you are going to work on first and how much time will you take to complete the work. Generally, what happens is everybody wants their work to be done first and as quickly as possible but you have only certain hours and you can&#x2019;t just sit all day to complete everything. In that case, setting the priorities and adding an approx figure of time will make it easier for you to schedule your work effectively and you can actually produce better results.</p><p>One more reason why you should be setting priorities and task estimates for your tasks because when you are in the creative field like design, usually, you forget about the time, you just keep exploring different UIs or keep reading multiple articles. Ultimately, taking the unnecessary time. So, whenever you start any task, keep in mind how much time are you going to spend on it.</p><p>So, do practice this. It will become a habit for you.</p><h3 id="06-to-become-proficient-take-ownership">06. To become proficient, Take Ownership</h3><p>I remember in my previous company, whenever something was given to me, I used to complete it and leave the office. But after joining NextUX, this attitude was completely changed.</p><p>In my initial days at NextUX, I had no direct responsibility, I just needed to report my daily tasks to my senior designer and just no client communication. But, in the third month of my job, Yagnesh assigned me to a very quite a big project. Though it was mostly done, I did not know they were moving to phase 2 development. I was quite afraid at that time to take such a big responsibility but I always had the back of Yagnesh.</p><p>On the initials day of working with that client, I remember I used to miss a lot of things in design, I did mistakes in the UIs, sometimes, I used to design something different than what was asked to. Sometimes, when working more than the working hours, I used to feel uneasy. But, along the way, I got to know the taste of ownership. After a period of time, When I realized I am the only person responsible for my work and it is my responsibility to do it, then I started paying extra attention and care about my work with that client. I felt like this was something I have been assigned to, the whole responsibility is mine, and I can&#x2019;t let it down.</p><p>From those days to now, I feel like a more confident designer, and also ready to take up any kind of work. For this, always grateful to <a href="https://medium.com/u/5e635919ea61">Yagnesh Ahir</a>.</p><blockquote>Once Abraham Lincoln said, <strong>&#x201C;&#x2026;if you want to test a man&#x2019;s character, give him power.&#x201D;</strong></blockquote><p>I just want to add one thing in this, <em>If you want to make someone proficient and responsible in doing something, then just give them ownership of that thing. And see the results.</em></p><h3 id="07-being-calm-should-be-your-1-skill">07. Being calm should be your #1 skill</h3><p>You are what you think, you do things based on how your mind is thinking. You have seen a lot of people who get frustrated easily, and they start doing things back and forth. Ultimately, missing a lot of things. I was once there and to overcome that, I learned the skill of being calm. It is not easy. And if you are not good at being calm, the above skills have no meaning.</p><p>The reason why you should learn the power of calmness because it has a very big impact on your way of working with people and producing good work. Most of the time, when we work with clients, developers, designers, end-users, deadlines then sometimes, it becomes too hectic and frustrating, and we start losing focus, which ultimately affects our decisions and work. In that situation, If you hold the calmness in your mind, then it will make the whole picture very clear and you can easily feel composed and confident.</p><p>Honestly, I was very bad at this, but from <a href="https://medium.com/u/5e635919ea61">Yagnesh Ahir</a>, I learned the importance of being calm. As when you are calm, you listen well, you communicate clearly, you make decisions wisely. And your productivity increases.</p><hr><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>When I joined the design industry, I always believed that it is my design skills that are going to take me forward in my design career. But, after joining the <a href="https://medium.com/nextuxdesign"><strong>NextUX Design Agency</strong></a> and meeting with these amazing designers and wonderful people, I had to change my mind. I learned that it not just about how good you are in designing interfaces or experiences, but you need to be good at these skills also.</p><p>Last but not least, I just want to thank <a href="https://medium.com/u/1557faf381d3">Dhanashree Manohar</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/5e635919ea61">Yagnesh Ahir</a> for making me not just a better designer but also a better person.

    background-color: red;

}</code></pre><p><em>We can specify it once and reuse it. It also reduces the headache of changing color values everywhere.</em></p><pre><code class="language-css">.my-class {
    color: red;

That means it&apos;d take this value from its parent element. So, if there is no color property specified in any parent elements, it&apos;ll take the default color set by the browser.</p><blockquote>FYI:<em> Since you can configure your OS theme, browsers also try to adopt them. Hence, there is no global default font color.</em></blockquote><h3 id="but-can-we-fool-currentcolor-by-specifying-multiple-color-values">But...

    color: blue;
}</code></pre><p>Now, if you&apos;ve understood the definition properly, you&apos;d know the value of currentColor must be <code>blue</code> and not red. Because it takes the current value of the color property <em>after computing all the CSS properties</em>.</p><hr><h2 id="why-currentcolor-is-in-camelcase">Why currentColor is in camelCase?</h2><p>Some of you must&apos;ve noticed that we&apos;re using camelCase here.

Even today, I see people not aware of this method. I&apos;ve also seen people only giving the same <code>shopping cart example</code> while explaining this method and, that&apos;s why I think people don&apos;t completely understand it. I feel this is the reason this method is underrated though it is powerful.</p><p>When I encountered this for the first time, I was happy with the regular for loop for doing the shopping cart calculation. I didn&apos;t feel like using it for such tasks. But after digging deep into this method, I realized I could do many more things.</p><p>After reading various tweets and blogs, I decided to write a detailed article on what exactly reduce method is and what can be some of its use cases. We won&apos;t be talking about the speed of regular for loop and .reduce() because the for loop is way faster than any other Array methods, be it <code>reduce</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>, <code>sort</code>, <code>forEach</code>, etc.</p><blockquote><em><strong>If you have any real-world use cases on your mind, do let me know.

This .reduce() also accepts a second argument: <code>initialValue</code>.</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">arr.reduce((accumulator, currentElement, currentIndex, array) =&gt; {
  // your logic goes here...
}, initialValue);</code></pre><h3 id="this-reducer-function-callback-takes-4-arguments-">This reducer function (callback) takes 4 arguments:</h3><ol><li><code><strong>accumulator</strong></code>: It accumulates all the values returned by the callback function. That means, at the end of the callback function, whatever value you return, it becomes the value of the accumulator for the next iteration. If you pass the <code>initialValue</code>, it becomes the value of the accumulator for the first iteration. Else, it takes the first value of the array in its first iteration.</li><li><code><strong>currentElement</strong></code>: It holds the value of the current element of the array that is being processed in the current iteration. If we don&apos;t pass the <code>initialValue</code> it starts with the 2nd element of the array because the accumulator takes the 1st element.</li><li><code><strong>currentIndex</strong></code>: It holds the index (<em>position</em>) of the <code>currentElement</code> in the array. <em>If there is no <code>initialValue</code>, it starts with index 1,</em> because that&apos;s the position of the currentElement in this case.</li><li><code><strong>array</strong></code>: This contains the original array on which we&apos;re executing the reduce method. You might need this array in some cases where you&apos;re importing the callback function from a different file and that file doesn&apos;t have any reference/context of the original array.</li></ol><p></p><blockquote><em><strong>Note: </strong>If we don&apos;t return any value at the end of the function, in the next iteration, the value of the accumulator becomes <code>undefined</code>.</em></blockquote><p></p><p>As per the documentation, the first 2 arguments (<em>accumulator and currentElement</em>) are required but we can execute this function without passing any arguments (<em>which is useless</em>).

Although we can achieve the same thing using <code>Map</code> but there are certain advantages and disadvantages of using <code>Map</code> over an <code>Object</code>.</p><p>Now, let&apos;s say you have an array of objects like this:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">const arr = [
    { key: &apos;Tom&apos;, value: &apos;Jerry&apos; },
    { key: &apos;Mario&apos;, value: &apos;Luigi&apos; },

  &quot;Tom&quot;: &quot;Jerry&quot;,
  &quot;Mario&quot;: &quot;Luigi&quot;,
  &quot;SpongeBob&quot;: &quot;Patrick&quot;,
}</code></pre><p>You can simply achieve this using <code>.reduce()</code> like in the example given below. Isn&apos;t it extremely simple and straightforward?</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">const keyPair = arr.reduce((acc, curr) =&gt; {
  acc[curr.key] = curr.value;
  return acc;
}, {});</code></pre><p>Okay, now that we discussed about <code>Map</code>, let&apos;s not leave the discussion there. Let&apos;s see how we can achieve the same thing in ES6&apos;s: <code>Map</code>. Here, we are not discussing which one is better because it depends on the use-case. We may discuss this in a separate blog. But for now let&apos;s enjoy this example.</p><p>Here, we&apos;ll use <code>.map()</code> to create a <code>Map</code>!!!</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">const keyPair = new Map(arr.map(
    item =&gt; [item.key, item.value]
));

console.log(keyPair); // {&quot;Tom&quot; =&gt; &quot;Jerry&quot;, &quot;Mario&quot; =&gt; &quot;Luigi&quot;, &quot;SpongeBob&quot; =&gt; &quot;Patrick&quot;}</code></pre><hr><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, our main focus was to understand and explore the different use-cases of <code>.reduce()</code>. Of course, it is slower than regular <code>for loop</code> but for relatively smaller objects/arrays, you won&apos;t even feel the difference (it also depends on the task you&apos;re performing on each element).</p><p>For the same reason, you can choose to use <code>reduce</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>forEach</code> etc. in the frontend because the browser has to run this code for only 1 client. But I would not recommend this in the backend because there are limited machines and they&apos;ve to handle a lot of requests. Even if you can save <code>10 ms</code> for a large object, it may make a huge difference while handling a lot of requests simultaneously. In such cases, you should go for the regular for loop. Even after optimizing your code from every corner you feel that the code is still slow, it&apos;s time to switch the language! (C/C++ maybe!)</p><p>Do let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/shah_apal">Twitter</a> (<em>and follow if possible</em> &#x1F648;) if you have any other use-cases on your mind which you use in production or you might&apos;ve thought something out of the box.

So, It is always best to avoid and take care of mistakes that might occur unknowingly or knowingly.</p><p>So today, I am going to talk about 3 UI/UX design mistakes we should avoid while designing the UI/UX of products.</p><h3 id="1-test-your-ui-with-an-actual-web-browser-phone-user-interface-"><strong>1. Test your UI with an actual web browser/ Phone user interface.</strong></h3><p>Most of the time we make mistakes of designing UI pages with leaving some of the design below the fold or under the scroll.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2600/1*fq6IyJCaU8I1K8NfyPumuQ.png" class="kg-image" alt="Common UI/UX design mistakes young designers should&#xA0;avoid" loading="lazy"></figure><p>The reason why we make this mistake is that we always pick the default artboard in the design tool and start designing from top to bottom without considering the real browser or phone height for which we are designing for. (This happens a lot in B2B products)</p><p>For the B2B products, most of the time, we consider the whole of the artboard in the design tool and start designing and placing the different UI components considering the full height, but what happens after the development, we get a lot of design request about things going below the fold or under the scroll. And then we get to rethink the whole design considering the actual height, which not only changes the UI but sometimes requires to rethink design decisions.</p><p>So, being a UI designer, we can ask our clients to give us the browser metrics of their products (If they have) or we can test our design with different browser windows in different screen sizes. (Remember responsive design is different)</p><h3 id="2-cross-check-your-design-with-real-data-before-giving-it-to-the-development-team-"><strong>2. Cross-check your design with real data before giving it to the development team.</strong></h3><p>Having real data at the start of the product design might be difficult or in some cases, there are chances that you will not have that. But not having them should not be a reason to not test your design with them, you can always have some dummy data, but the real one(Say no to lorem ipsum).</p><p>Applying the data to your UI components will always help you in deciding the spacing and margin that should be given to particular components or between components. Even in some cases, when things are mandatory or necessary to be shown, you can decide how much data to show or how much to hide.</p><p><strong>For example,</strong></p><p>You have designed a table with random data without considering the actual characters of data or what might come in the rows, then there will be chances that when you put real content, your content might float outside the table or you have to adjust your spacing to accommodate them or even in bad scenarios, you have to reconsider the whole designs.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2600/1*ddeTdvt78kYmz_D7Iy8a6w.png" class="kg-image" alt="Common UI/UX design mistakes young designers should&#xA0;avoid" loading="lazy"></figure><p>So, it is always best to apply or add real data to your designs, and if there are issues just change the design or make a decision that is scalable for your future designs.</p><p>Placing the real data in UI is always the best decision.</p><h3 id="3-not-considering-all-the-states-of-a-flow-or-experience"><strong>3. Not considering all the states of a flow or Experience</strong></h3><p>It&#x2019;s going to be a rarity that you create a screen in your interface that has only 1 state. The reality is that the world in which we live isn&#x2019;t perfect, and things go wrong. Servers take time to respond. And your users won&#x2019;t always use your product the way in which you intended.</p><p>When you are designing the experiences, you must always think about the complete experience, from the start to the end, also in-between states, edge cases like what will happen when there will be an error, or how would the UI look like the first time.</p><p>Suppose, If you are designing a search feature for your product, then ideally you would think of the following states,</p><ol><li>Search Input box,</li><li>Search Results.</li><li>Selecting a search</li><li>No results found (Empty State)</li></ol><p>But if you think of searching elements as an experience then you would realize that you have missed some of the states.</p><p>So, let&#x2019;s us consider all the states that might appear in your product&#x2019;s search experience,</p><ol><li>Input Box.</li><li>Hover state.</li><li>When you click on the search box, there will be some recent search or there might not be.</li><li>How you will show when users start typing the search.</li><li>When you select an option, how would the search loading look like (skeleton screen)</li><li>How would be the empty state screen if there are no search results (Empty State)</li><li>What will happen when the user clears the search (User Cleared State)</li><li>What will happen if there are server errors or system errors (Error State)</li><li>What will be the ideal state (Search results)</li><li>What will be the partial state (Between empty state and ideal state, when there are 2 or 1 search results)</li></ol><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2600/1*Dvp7MzZulyNlcIUCptDjbg.png" class="kg-image" alt="Common UI/UX design mistakes young designers should&#xA0;avoid" loading="lazy"></figure><p>All of these states(cases) are part of what the users might experience. And leaving any of these will leave a gap in the overall user experience of the product. So, being a good UXer, always try to include and design all the state or edge cases that your product feature might go through in reality.</p><h3 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>The above mistakes are such mistakes that you might make unintentionally, but making them might result in continuous design requests from your client development teams, eventually increasing your design work. So, before reaching to the final designs, always confirm and make sure whether you are making these mistakes or not, if you are, just design them well.</p><p>Happy Designing and thank you for reading.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[React.js â How to execute useEffect hook only once?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Have you ever faced this issue that your useEffect hook gets executed multiple times?

Maybe sometimes it goes into the infinite loop?</p><p>When React released the hooks feature, everyone jumped into it and started exploring new features and use-cases. I also started using functional components and completely abandoned the &quot;class components&quot; in my new projects.</p><p>In all of my projects, I was using some backend APIs and I was quite comfortable with <code>componentDidMount</code>. Because it was calling the APIs only once. And even after updating the redux store or state, it wasn&apos;t executing the same code inside <code>componentDidMount</code> again unlike the <code>useEffect()</code>. So I decided to check how useEffect works. After reading the official docs properly, I got some amazing results. And I&apos;m using them for almost a year now.</p><h2 id="useeffect-basics">useEffect() basics</h2><p>In this section, I won&apos;t dive too deep into the basics because there are a lot of blogs and video tutorials out there that explain everything. Rather, we&apos;ll focus on how to use this properly and avoid unnecessary function calls and re-renders. So, let&apos;s start with the simple code.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code class="language-javascript">import React, { useEffect } from &apos;react&apos;;

function App() {
  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    console.log(&apos;Hello from useEffect!&apos;);
  });
  console.log(&apos;Hello from the component!&apos;);

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;Hello World&lt;/div&gt;
  );
}

export default App;
</code></pre><figcaption>Simple functional component with useEffect hook!</figcaption></figure><p>If you run this code, you can see that the useEffect hook will be called only after executing all the code inside our component. The class equivalent code of this snippet would be something like this:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">import React from &apos;react&apos;;

class App extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    console.log(&apos;Hello from useEffect!&apos;);
  }

  componentDidUpdate() {
    console.log(&apos;Hello from useEffect!&apos;);
  }

  render() {
    console.log(&apos;Hello from the Component!&apos;);

    return (
      &lt;div&gt;Hello World&lt;/div&gt;
    );
  }
}

export default App;</code></pre><p>Now, as you all know, if we try to manipulate the state or redux store, it re-renders the component. It means this <code>useEffect</code> hook will also be executed after updating the state or props. If you&apos;re updating the state or props inside this hook, it would simply go into <strong>an infinite loop</strong> because of this.</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">// Infinite loop alert!
import React, { useEffect, useState } from &apos;react&apos;;

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    console.log(&apos;Hello from useEffect!&apos;);
    setCount(count + 1);
  });
  console.log(&apos;Hello from the component!&apos;);

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;Hello World&lt;/div&gt;
  );
}

export default App;
</code></pre><h2 id="how-to-prevent-this-infinite-loop">How to prevent this infinite loop?</h2><p>When I shifted from Class components to Functional components, I didn&apos;t know that the <code>useEffect</code> hook also accepts the second parameter. And this parameter is somewhat responsible for controlling when this hook gets executed.</p><h3 id="so-what-is-this-second-parameter">So what is this second parameter?</h3><p>This second parameter accepts an array. We can provide different variables, i.e. the variables created by <code>useState</code> or <code>redux</code> from <code>props</code> in this array. If we pass an empty array <code>[]</code>, it just renders the component only once like <code>componentDidMount</code>. Let&apos;s look at this example:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">import React, { useEffect, useState } from &apos;react&apos;;

  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    console.log(&apos;Hello from useEffect!&apos;);
  }, []);

  console.log(&apos;Hello from the component!&apos;);

    setTimeout(() =&gt; {
      setCount(count + 1);

</code></pre><p>In this code, the code inside <code>useEffect</code> will only get executed once even if we change the value of the variable <code>count</code> multiple times. It&apos;d print &quot;Hello from the component!&quot; twice but it&apos;d print &quot;Hello from useEffect&quot; only once.</p><p>If you&apos;ve noticed, I&apos;m increasing the value of <code>count</code> only once using the if condition. Because after passing the second argument, it won&apos;t execute <code>useEffect</code> hook again but it&apos;ll try to re-render the component by executing the other code. You can try changing the value in if condition to verify whatever we&apos;ve done so far.</p><p>In the beginning, we saw that the class equivalent code of <code>useEffect</code> was also executing the code after the component finishes re-rendering. And it is also possible to re-render a component only on a specific condition in the class components. So there must be a way to do this using <code>useEffect</code>.</p><h2 id="how-to-conditionally-execute-useeffect">How to conditionally execute useEffect?</h2><p>Let&apos;s take the same example. Now we&apos;ll modify the array we passed in the second argument. If I want to execute the <code>useEffect</code> hook again only if the value of <code>count</code> changes, I can pass the <code>count</code> in the array like this:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">import React, { useEffect, useState } from &apos;react&apos;;

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    console.log(&apos;Hello from useEffect!&apos;);
  }, [count]); // &lt;-- See the change here

  console.log(&apos;Hello from the component!&apos;);

  if(count &lt; 1) {
    setTimeout(() =&gt; {
      setCount(count + 1);
    }, 1000);
  }

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;Hello World&lt;/div&gt;
  );
}

export default App;</code></pre><p>This code will execute <code>useEffect</code> hook after the first component render just like <code>componentDidMount</code>. And after that, it&apos;ll only get executed if we change the value of count somehow. This is not only valid for the variables we create using useState. We can also use them for the different props be it coming from redux or some value from the parent component.</p><h3 id="how-to-pass-props-in-this-array">How to pass props in this array?</h3><p>It is pretty simple and straight forward to use different props a component is getting from either redux or the parent component.</p><p>E.g. if we&apos;re getting the email from the props as <code>props.email</code>, we can simply write our array like this: <code>[props.email]</code>. We can also pass multiple variables in this array: <code>[count, props.email, props.name]</code>. In this case, it&apos;ll execute <code>useEffect</code> whenever the value of either count, email or name gets changed.</p><h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2><p>I wrote this blog to show why <code>useEffect</code> hook gets executed multiple times and how to prevent this by passing the second argument. I had discussed about the best practices too many times with a lot of people in my organisation and also in a lot of meetups/conferences but we never concluded anything unanimously.

Every UI communicates something, it has colors, typography, and spaces to give you something to communicate. Not only this, but a great UI becomes an advocate for the great UX. An interface is the first thing in the roadmap of giving great UX to the users.</p><p>So, today we are going to talk about rules of UI which every UI Designer should understand to design the meaningful and purposeful UI.</p><p>In this post, we are going to learn and talk about,</p><ol><li><strong><strong>General view of UI Design</strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong>Organization of visual information</strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong>Colors</strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong>Typography</strong></strong></li></ol><hr><h2 id="1-general-view-of-ui-design">1. General View of UI Design</h2><p>UI Design is the front door of every product. It is the first thing that a user or a customer will interact with and a well-designed UI should be responsible to take the user into the journey of the product.</p><p>UI design must be purposefully designed, you must deeply care about the things which you will be putting in the UI, every unnecessary item on the UI can create friction or unwanted noise to the users which eventually reduces the usability and separate out the product from the real purpose.</p><p><strong><strong>Communicating meaning</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>showing possible actions</strong></strong> are the two major factors we design the UI for, and both should never be compromised in favor of visual design choices.</p><p>A great UI should always feel like it is communicating something to the user and clearly indicating what they can do on the interface.</p><p>A good UI is always built on the foundation of prioritizing information and defining clear actions.</p><p>So, let us next focus on how different factors play a role in putting out content and creating a meaningful structure of the UI.</p><hr><h2 id="2-organization-of-visual-information">2.

From the start of the day to the end of the day, every second is an experience, bad or good, and as it includes us, it becomes a User Experience. Because we as the people are the users of everything that is around us.</p><p>From the initial designs of the wheel to the current technologies, UX was always there. But from the past 30 years, we have started noticing it and defining it as the major success rationale for products and companies. And now we are at the stage where everybody wants the best UX in their products and every consumer expects the best UX in every product they use. But still, we are not at the stage, where everybody understands the real UX and how to achieve it.</p><p>You know, UX has the sole purpose of giving users a delightful and satisfying experience. No matter what the product or service is, it is everyone&#x2019;s right to get the best user experience. When companies focus on giving its customers the best experience and when it is done right, both the customers and companies win.</p><p><strong><strong>Good UX makes the life of people simpler and worlds a better place</strong></strong>. <em><em>Cliche Dialogue, but it is a vision for all.</em></em></p><p><strong><strong>So, What is User Experience Design?</strong></strong></p><p>I think everybody knows the answers, but let me tell you in my way, which is. what I think and explain to others &#x2014; <em><em>just breakdown the term, </em></em><strong><strong><em><em>which is U for Users and X for Experience,</em></em></strong></strong><em><em> and in a sentence, </em></em><strong><strong><em><em>It is how the users of the products or service feel while or after using the product or service</em></em></strong></strong><em><em>(you can use the single word, product or service, both).</em></em></p><p>If you look at the word, It has just 2 words, User and Experience, but in the whole, it sums up our whole day and every part of life, because every single second we are using some kind of product or service.</p><p>But if UX is everywhere, then why we don&#x2019;t have it best at every place, Why there are products or places which sometimes frustrates us? Why sometimes we are unable to use some products? Why sometimes we find ourself lost in them?</p><p>The simple answer to this is, things are not well designed. UX is a bigger thing, and it depends on a lot of factors, and when these factors are ignored or not taken care well enough, it affects the user experience of the products, eventually making the company and people suffers.</p><p>So, today I am going to talk about different factors that are needed to design the good User Experiences for the different products.</p><h3 id="people-users">People/Users</h3><p>People or say, users, are the core part of any experience. Every experience is incomplete without the people, even every experience is built for the people. But still, sometimes we fail. Because we fail to understand them. People have a life, and in that life, they have problems. And to solve their problems, we don&#x2019;t just need to understand the day but their life too like who they are, what are their mindsets, what they love, how they spend their life, what they believe. I know, understanding the life of every person is a difficult and big task, but understanding the core of their life is important. Without understanding people deeply and their problems, we might not be able to design for them, our product will always lack something.</p><p>Whenever we start a design, we should always ask questions in terms of users, and we should be really honest about our answer to making the products really useful and sometimes, we need to ask directly to people. And this is really important because if we skip the people or ignore them, then no matter what the best features or cool interactions your products have, people, will not use them.</p><p>Eventually, we are designing for people, and if we don&#x2019;t understand them well enough then all our hard work will result in vain.</p><h3 id="demographic-place-time">Demographic, Place, Time</h3><p>Different people live in different countries, different cities, they speak different languages, have different cultures. And maybe they could have some common things, but that is not the case with everybody.</p><p>Understanding people is one bigger task, but where they live and how they live are really next important question that can help you in understanding their context and situation better. And the sole reason to understand their place of living can help you in understanding their way of living life in that country or state or city. Researching about the demographic can help you in understanding the different challenges your users face.</p><p>Another reason to research about their demographic is to understand what language, and culture they follow in their demographics. Also, it can help you in understanding the current age of the people and helps in deciding the level of product intelligence for the users.</p><h3 id="product-usage">Product Usage</h3><p>The questions like when your product or service is going to be used or how many times a day they are going to use, are such important questions that if you have not considered that while designing, then it might make your users feel miserable and frustrating every time they use your product.</p><p>Suppose you have a product which is going to be used 20 times a day, and you have not considered this factor, then you can imagine how your users are going to feel 20 times whenever they use the product.</p><p>Also, suppose you have built a product for some company and your product has bad user experience and is complex, then just imagine how the people employed by that company is going to feel in their daily job hours and how this is going to impact in their other life areas. User Experience is really a big circle, one bad experience can have a worse impact on other parts of their life.</p><p>Usage hours is one thing. Another is where it is going to be used like in closed environments or open environments. Defining the places early in product storyboards could really help in discovering different challenges where your product might not be used or would be difficult to use.</p><p>Understanding product usage areas and time can help you in curating out the external factors and challenges that might make your users feel miserable while using your product.</p><h3 id="knowledge-and-literacy-level-of-expertise-and-training">Knowledge and literacy, level of expertise, and training</h3><p>The level of knowledge required to use the products is the key rationale behind the success of products, and today every product has an onboarding tour so that they would not miss any opportunity to let the users use their products.</p><p>Understanding the knowledge factor of your users could really help you in building the initial process of the products. I am not talking about what are their qualifications, rather I am talking about their familiarities of different products or services, like how much they use such kind of products or how much they know about the technology, etcetera etcetera.</p><p>For example, you have a new product category that nobody has ever seen or used the similar kind, then just assume how your users are going to use your products, but if you know that your users have never used this kind of product, then you might be able to give something to users so that they can understand the product before using it and eventually start using your products.</p><p>Thinking that everybody knows everything could be a dangerous assumption. You need to really understand what they know and how much they know about the things.</p><h3 id="needs-wants-and-goals">Needs, Wants and Goals</h3><p>Every person has their needs, wants and basic goals and it is the responsibility of the product makers to rightly assume and curate them because to build a great user experience we really need to understand what is actually needed by the users, and what they want to achieve.</p><p>Goals are the real motivation in people&#x2019;s lives, and everybody&#x2019;s daily goal is to complete more number of goals compared to yesterday. And they take help of our products to accomplish their goals. So, to make products great, your product needs to help your users achieve their goals. And if they are good in that, then your users would love the whole experience.</p><p>So, always try to focus on the user&apos;s goal so that you can really understand what they need to achieve their goals.</p><h3 id="features">Features</h3><p>Features are the real thing that attracts the people, but that not ensures either it is a great product or has the best user experience. Features are something that ensures the complexity of the products in terms of usability, accessibility and overall user experience. Features must be well designed in order to help users in achieving their goals. If we think that by giving every single feature to the users will increase their engagement and delight them, then you might be wrong. In order to build a great user experience, we need to work towards in simplifying the only features that are core to the users and building the rest upon them. Understanding what matters to people should be your matter too.</p><p>Remember, Every product has features but not every feature is used by each customer. So, try to focus on not making your product features heavy, rather always tries to focus on core features and making them easier for the users to use them.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>Factors are important when we try to build something, no matter whether it is a service, product or a building. Factors are something that helps us in understanding the real usage of the products and reducing the challenges that our users might face while using the products.</p><p>These are not the only factors for building good user experience, but you can consider these as some of the major factors that can help you in researching the people and building great things for them.</p><h3 id="thanks-for-reading-">Thanks for reading.</h3>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[UX Laws, My first Chrome extension]]></title><description><![CDATA[UX Laws is chrome extension for your new tabs, everytime you open a new tab, you will see a UX Design law.]]></description><link>https://gosink.in/ux-laws-a-chrome-extension/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">607c5ad13bb4ecbd6cf336e7</guid><category><![CDATA[chrome extension]]></category><category><![CDATA[ux laws]]></category><category><![CDATA[UX Design]]></category><category><![CDATA[UI]]></category><category><![CDATA[Design]]></category><category><![CDATA[user experience]]></category><category><![CDATA[Design thinking]]></category><category><![CDATA[Design Value]]></category><category><![CDATA[UX designers]]></category><category><![CDATA[Triangle-shaped designer]]></category><category><![CDATA[Product Designers]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Aman Gupta]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 02 Mar 2020 15:49:05 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://gosink.in/content/images/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-02-at-8.48.10-PM.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://gosink.in/content/images/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-02-at-8.48.10-PM.png" alt="UX Laws, My first Chrome extension"><p>Hello Friends,</p><p>Today I am going to share with you my first chrome extension, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ux-laws/gkenaaobobgpgoholclhgkecnbhdbjpa"><strong>UX Laws</strong></a> that I have built for myself and also for all the new UX designers. </p><p>Basically, I have just converted the <a href="https://lawsofux.com/">Laws of UX</a> website into a chrome version.</p><p>The design of this chrome extension is inspired from the 77 things chrome extension by Uber. </p><p>My major goal behind this chrome extension was to learn and remember different UX design laws.

A lot of them feel lonely and boring throughout the days. And sometimes they want to enjoy the best things with their family, and friends despite living distance away from it.</p><h4 id="solution">Solution</h4><p>Considering the things that people love to do in a group, I have designed an app where people can create different groups and watch shows, videos from different apps and listen to music together in a single place.</p><hr><h4 id="context">Context</h4><p>We, humans, are social animals. Whether we live in faraway cities or just a few miles away, we always love to spend time with our friends and family.</p><p>We always love to do things together, no matter whether you are an extrovert or introvert. But sometimes, things become difficult when we get separated from our friends and family. And reasons could be many, we might have chosen a job at a different location, or we might have to go to some university which is out of our native places, similarly, there could be several reasons.</p><p>But, today, modern apps like Facebook, WhatsApp and many different apps have given us a platform to connect with our friends no matter where we are and moreover, today we have the multiple apps along with highly capable phones that supports group video calling and much. Nowadays, It has become really easy to connect with anyone, no matter what the time and location is. But still, sometimes, people feel alone and just miss their friends and family while they live alone in some other city or country.</p><p>So, I just talked with one of my colleague who is a developer in my company and living far from his native town. He has been living in this city from the past 3 years.</p><p>One day, on an after-lunch walk, I asked him to share his experience when living far from his family, which is how he spends his free time on weekends and what he does when he is alone, what are the things he misses most when he is here.</p><p>He shared about how every weekend he does video calls to his old friends and they meet once in a year at someplace. He watches movies every weekend with his new friends and always misses his old days.</p><p>He also shared that sometimes in a day, he misses his old friends that he had in his hometown, He missed those times where he used to spend time together with them.</p><p>This was a single person who I was talking, but there are millions of people who are out of their home town or left their home to do a certain job or for further studies.</p><p>So, I was thinking about how I can provide a solution to all these people who feel alone and miss the time when they used to spend time together with their family and friends and now they are unable to do so.</p><p>So I was thinking about what if I can have a solution where they can do things in groups while being in different locations.</p><p>So let&#x2019;s design an MVP concept to address the problem.</p><h4 id="goal"><strong>Goal</strong></h4><p>My goal was to take the things people love to do in groups in real life to a digital platform.</p><p><strong>So I started my research.</strong></p><hr><h2 id="research">Research</h2><h4 id="interview">Interview</h4><p>So, I started interviewing my school friends and colleagues who are living outside their native places.</p><p>I started with two questions,</p><p><strong>What is their daily experience when they live out of their native places?</strong></p><p>After listening to them, I took out some of their feelings for what they feel bad about.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*gOY382KqH42Q5PEcEzYKMQ.png" class="kg-image" alt="Designed an app, Along, to let people watch and listen together." loading="lazy"><figcaption>Insights from the interview.</figcaption></figure><p>I believe sometimes your bad feelings lead you in some problems. So, feelings are like the pain points that we can address and solve through designs. So, I was really after the feelings of my users when I interviewed them.</p><p>The second question was,</p><p><strong>What are some of the things they love to do in the group?</strong></p><p>Here are the answers,</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*zGxSV808ut-mqdZIxIv5FA.png" class="kg-image" alt="Designed an app, Along, to let people watch and listen together." loading="lazy"><figcaption>List of things&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026; created using&#xA0;<a href="http://Miro.com" data-href="http://Miro.com" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">miro</a></figcaption></figure><p>So I was next interested in picking out things from this list and explore the different workarounds people do in real life. <em>Tip: Exploring workarounds are the real source to find real opportunities and design new solutions.</em></p><p><strong>Group video and conference calling, chatting, polling, gaming apps </strong>are already in the market, but I think, as today, people are spending so much time on smartphones for everyday activities, so why not introduce more things that people can do in groups on the same smartphone.</p><p>So I picked out 2 things from the list for which I explored the different workarounds people do in real life.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*P3tD3AtTa7Mv7cm1cUsqtQ.png" class="kg-image" alt="Designed an app, Along, to let people watch and listen together." loading="lazy"></figure><p><br></p><h4 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h4><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*kaiQvzEXa4UtcpL2irrLgg.png" class="kg-image" alt="Designed an app, Along, to let people watch and listen together." loading="lazy"><figcaption>for watching&#xA0;movies.</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*XEEM_gi8BOPV7CNdzP5PUw.png" class="kg-image" alt="Designed an app, Along, to let people watch and listen together." loading="lazy"><figcaption>For listening to&#xA0;songs.</figcaption></figure><p>There is one of the major problems in these workarounds and that is the <strong>people need to be at the same place to enjoy things together</strong>. And they have to use the traditional methods to enjoy things together like <strong>sound systems, night outs, Bluetooth.</strong></p><p>So, I researched how people do these things on a digital platform. I found out a lot of different apps, websites where people can listen to songs and watch online content together with their friends and family.</p><p>And also I did a competitive analysis on some of the best apps in this domain area.</p><h4 id="competitive-analysis">Competitive analysis</h4><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*r2Q5UGgncEYGpoMXJZ771g.png" class="kg-image" alt="Designed an app, Along, to let people watch and listen together." loading="lazy"><figcaption>List of&#xA0;apps&#xA0;</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2600/1*mG1G7z81r3okD7Xcgkoo9Q.png" class="kg-image" alt="Designed an app, Along, to let people watch and listen together." loading="lazy"><figcaption>Competitive analysis <a href="https://www.notion.so/426463d6468d46f9994840ecd55f7424?v=231cd6d5e0e34561915635768ae93aab" data-href="https://www.notion.so/426463d6468d46f9994840ecd55f7424?v=231cd6d5e0e34561915635768ae93aab" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.notion.so/426463d6468d46f9994840ecd55f7424?v=231cd6d5e0e34561915635768ae93aab</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>View my complete detailed competitive analysis in Notion.</strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://www.notion.so/426463d6468d46f9994840ecd55f7424?v=231cd6d5e0e34561915635768ae93aab"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">Notion &#x2013; The all-in-one workspace for your notes, tasks, wikis, and databases.</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">A new tool that blends your everyday work apps into one.

src="https://gosink.in/content/images/2020/02/toggle-theme.jpg" alt="Javascript &amp; CSS &#x2014; Toggle dark/light theme based on your user&apos;s preferred scheme"><p>After the release of the <code>dark theme</code> in all the major platforms like macOS X, Windows 10, Android, etc. it has become very famous, especially among the developers. People also believe that it helps them reduce eye strain, which is true only if the colors and their contrast are not chosen poorly. Also, it saves battery for some OLED/AMOLED screens.</p><p>For the UI/UX developers, it&apos;s a new (<em>but optional</em>) challenge to build two separate and equally beautiful designs. Also, it is useful to analyze what is your user&apos;s preferred color scheme.</p><p><em>You can also try toggling between these two themes on this blog</em>. This blog (which is using Casper theme by Ghost) also has this feature.</p><p>This blog is not focused on whether to use the dark theme in your web app. Instead, it focuses on how to switch between the dark and the light theme as per your user&apos;s preference.</p><hr><h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2><p>It&apos;s just a simple media query: <code>prefers-color-scheme</code></p><p>This query has been introduced in the <em><a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries-5/">Media Queries Level 5 draft</a></em> and it can have the following values:</p><ol><li><code>light</code>: The user prefers a page with a light theme. Typically, a light background with the dark fonts.</li><li><code>dark</code>: The user prefers a page with a dark theme. A dark background with relatively lighter fonts.</li><li><code>no-preference</code>: This means the system doesn&apos;t know the preference of the user. I generally prefer to display the light theme in this case.</li></ol><hr><h2 id="enabling-dark-theme-using-css">Enabling Dark theme using CSS</h2><p>There are multiple ways to do this using CSS.</p><h3 id="using-media-query-inside-your-css-file-">Using media query inside your CSS file:</h3><p>This is the most straightforward way to implement the dark theme in your app. And if your browser supports the dark theme, it will work for almost all the cases. The example below can be the simplest one to explain this point.</p><pre><code class="language-css">/* style.css */
body {
    background-color: #fafafa;
    color: #222222;
}

@media(prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
    body {
    	background-color: #222222;
        color: #fafafa;
    }
}</code></pre><h3 id="using-media-query-in-link-tag-">Using media query in &lt;link&gt; tag:</h3><pre><code class="language-html">&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;dark.css&quot; media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&quot;&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;light.css&quot; media=&quot;(prefers-color-scheme: no-preference), (prefers-color-scheme: light)&quot;&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;</code></pre><p>Here&apos;s the tricky part in this case. If this media query is not supported by the browser, it will load all the CSS. So, you must give preference to one theme for such cases. In the example above, you can see that even if the media query fails, the light theme will override the dark theme.</p><hr><h2 id="then-why-do-we-need-javascript">Then why do we need Javascript?</h2><p>In some cases, CSS only approach is not sufficient.</p><p>For example, if you want to know the user&apos;s preferred scheme for analytics. Or you are loading different text/images using Javascript (<em>can be a different API call</em>) and you want a listener for the change in theme. These things can&apos;t be handled by CSS.</p><h3 id="check-the-preferred-theme-using-javascript-">Check the preferred theme using Javascript:</h3><pre><code class="language-javascript">if (window.matchMedia(&apos;prefers-color-scheme: dark&apos;).matches) {
  // It&apos;s a dark theme...
} else {
  // It&apos;s not a dark theme...
}</code></pre><p>Don&apos;t forget to check if <code>matchMedia</code> is there in the <code>window</code> object. It might throw an error if it&apos;s not supported by the browser.</p><h3 id="listen-to-the-change-in-theme-">Listen to the change in theme:</h3><p>The user can change the theme while accessing your website. The code above can&apos;t help detecting the change in theme. To achieve this, we need a listener which listens on the change in preferred theme by the user.</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">window.matchMedia(&apos;(prefers-color-scheme: dark)&apos;).addListener(e =&gt; {
  if (e.matches) {
    console.log(&apos;dark mode is enabled&apos;);
  } else {
    console.log(&apos;dark mode is disabled&apos;);
  }
});</code></pre><hr><p><strong>If you want to learn more about the implementation and the best practices, check out these links:</strong></p><p><a href="https://uxplanet.org/8-tips-for-dark-theme-design-8dfc2f8f7ab6">https://uxplanet.org/8-tips-for-dark-theme-design-8dfc2f8f7ab6</a><br><a href="https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html#">https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html</a><br><a href="https://www.toptal.com/designers/ui/dark-ui">https://www.toptal.com/designers/ui/dark-ui</a></p><hr><h2 id="implementation">Implementation </h2><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rz3QseHtUNI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="browser-support">Browser support</h2><p>As of now (<em>Feb 2020</em>), the dark mode is supported by all the recent versions of the major browsers.

When I started coding 4 years back, I didn&apos;t know about this and I used to ignore them. But after being assigned to a project which handles around a million requests in a few minutes, this was no longer a case. I had no other option but to optimize the code (<em>Because we&apos;d reached the level where vertical scaling was no longer possible</em>).</p><p>So in this article, I would like to talk about these common mistakes everyone makes and usually ignores. And also there are some possible solutions to these mistakes.</p><hr><h2 id="mistake-1-using-try-catch-inside-the-promise-block">Mistake #1: Using try/catch inside the Promise block</h2><p>It&apos;s redundant to use <code>try/catch</code> inside a Promise block (<em>btw, this contradicts the Mistake #2</em>). If your code throws an error inside the Promise block, it&apos;ll automatically be handled by the catch scope.</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">// This is redundant
new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
  try {
    const data = someFunction();
    // your logic
    resolve();
  } catch (e) {
    reject(e);
  }
})
  .then(data =&gt; console.log(data))
  .catch(error =&gt; console.log(error));</code></pre><p>Instead, let the code throw an error and handle it outside your Promise like this:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">// Instead try this
new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
  const data = someFunction();
  // your logic
  resolve()
})
  .then(data =&gt; console.log(data))
  .catch(error =&gt; console.log(error));
</code></pre><p>This will always work except in the case below.</p><h2 id="mistake-2-using-async-function-inside-your-promise-block">Mistake #2: Using async function inside your Promise block</h2><h3 id="there-are-some-side-effects-of-an-async-function-inside-a-promise-block">There are some side effects of an async function inside a Promise block</h3><p>Now, let&apos;s say in your Promise block, you want to perform some async task and you add the `async` keyword and your code might throw an error. But now, you cannot handle this error even if there is a <code>.catch()</code> block or you <code>await</code> your promise inside a <code>try/catch</code> block.</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">// This code can&apos;t handle this error
new Promise(async () =&gt; {
  throw new Error(&apos;message&apos;);
}).catch(e =&gt; console.log(e.message));


// This will also fail to handle the error
(async () =&gt; {
  try {
    await new Promise(async () =&gt; {
      throw new Error(&apos;message&apos;);
    });
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e.message);
  }
})();
</code></pre><p>Whenever I see async functions inside a Promise block, I always try to separate the async logic outside the Promise block to make that block synchronous. And this works 9/10 times. But still, for some cases, you might need an async function. In that case, you don&apos;t have any other option but to handle that manually by <code>try/catch</code> block.</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">new Promise(async (resolve, reject) =&gt; {
  try {
    throw new Error(&apos;message&apos;);
  } catch (error) {
    reject(error);
  }
}).catch(e =&gt; console.log(e.message));


// Or using async/await
(async () =&gt; {
  try {
    await new Promise(async (resolve, reject) =&gt; {
      try {
        throw new Error(&apos;message&apos;);
      } catch (error) {
        reject(error);
      }
    });
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e.message);
  }
})();
</code></pre><h2 id="mistake-3-forgetting-catch-block">Mistake #3: Forgetting .catch() block</h2><p>Typically, this is a mistake you generally don&apos;t know you&apos;re making until some of your test cases fail. Or if you&apos;re a kind of test-atheist who doesn&apos;t believe in writing tests, this code will definitely crash in production. Because the production environment strictly follows Murphy&apos;s law.</p><blockquote>&quot;Anything that can go wrong will go wrong&quot; - Murphy&apos;s law</blockquote><p>To make your code more elegant, you can await your promise in the <code>try/catch</code> block instead of using <code>.then().catch()</code>.</p><h2 id="mistake-4-not-using-promise-all-">Mistake #4: Not using Promise.all()</h2><h3 id="promise-all-is-your-friend">Promise.all() is your friend</h3><p>If you&apos;re a pro developer, you already know what I&apos;m going to talk about here. If you have multiple promises which are independent of each other, you can resolve all of them concurrently. By default, the Promises are concurrent in nature but If you&apos;re <code>await</code>ing them one by one it will take too much time. <code>Promise.all()</code> will save you a lot of waiting time.</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">const { promisify } = require(&apos;util&apos;);
const sleep = promisify(setTimeout);

async function f1() {
  await sleep(1000);
}

async function f2() {
  await sleep(2000);
}

async function f3() {
  await sleep(3000);
}

// Running code sequentially
(async () =&gt; {
  console.time(&apos;sequential&apos;);
  await f1();
  await f2();
  await f3();
  console.timeEnd(&apos;sequential&apos;); // Approx 6 seconds
})();</code></pre><p><strong>This code takes around 6 seconds to execute. Now if we replace the code with <code>Promise.all()</code>, it will take around 3 seconds.</strong></p><pre><code class="language-javascript">(async () =&gt; {
  console.time(&apos;concurrent&apos;);
  await Promise.all([f1(), f2(), f3()]);
  console.timeEnd(&apos;concurrent&apos;); // Approx 3 seconds
})();</code></pre><h2 id="mistake-5-using-promise-race-without-complete-understanding-">Mistake #5: Using Promise.race() without complete understanding.</h2><h3 id="it-doesn-t-necessarily-make-your-code-faster">It doesn&apos;t necessarily make your code faster</h3><p>This might seem a little controversial statement but it&apos;s true. I&apos;m not saying that <code>Promise.race()</code> is useless but you must know why you&apos;re using this.</p><p>This is useful if you want to run your code immediately after any one of your Promises resolves. But that doesn&apos;t mean that it will exit the code immediately after that. It will wait until all the promises get resolved and only after that, it will release the thread. So make decisions wisely.</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">const { promisify } = require(&apos;util&apos;);
const sleep = promisify(setTimeout);

async function f1() {
  await sleep(1000);
}

async function f2() {

}

async function f3() {
  await sleep(3000);
}

(async () =&gt; {
  console.time(&apos;race&apos;);
  await Promise.race([f1(), f2(), f3()]);
})();

process.on(&apos;exit&apos;, () =&gt; {
  console.timeEnd(&apos;race&apos;); // Approx 3 seconds
});
</code></pre><p><strong>As you can see in the code above, it will take 3 seconds to exit instead of 1 second.</strong></p><h2 id="mistake-6-overuse-of-promises">Mistake #6: Overuse of Promises</h2><h3 id="they-make-your-code-slower-don-t-overuse-them">They make your code slower; don&apos;t overuse them</h3><p>We generally see developers using a long chain of <code>.then()</code> just to make their code look elegant. You won&apos;t notice any difference until this chain is too long.

But, for us the UX designers, this is not enough.</p><p>When a new designer joins a company, he/she has very little knowledge of the company and the products it makes, until it is some big company. Sometimes, though, if it is a big company, then also, it becomes really important to completely understand the product you are going to work for. Because for the designers, the importance of knowing the problems of the products is as important as knowing the whole product and why the company is making such a product. But sometimes, what happens is, people in the team are so busy to tell you every single detail about the product that they miss the most important whys and whats of the product, and eventually, we would not be able to address the real problem of the product for the users.</p><p>So, it becomes really important as individuals to take responsibility to not just understand the product, instead, to be willing to ask questions to ourself and company to understand everything that we should be knowing of the company, product and the users. Because we can&#x2019;t help solving the problems until we know everything. And one way to get the answers is to ask the right questions, and before asking the right questions, we need to have the questions.</p><p>I have faced this similar problem in my previous company, and to solve this problem, I have created a set of questions or I can say a template to ask the different question to myself and other members of the team and to different departments of the company so that I can be able to learn more about the product than the product manager and the CEO and be able to solve the problems of the product.</p><p>So, I just wanted to share that document with the people who might need it and I wish, It might help the new and young designers, as it helped me to get the information I &#xA0;needed before starting to work for that product.</p><hr><p><em>Disclaimer,</em></p><p><em>Please note that this document is not user research or UX research template.

No doubt. However, I have too spent days deciding a perfect colour for a button.</p><p>But after going through the whole brainstorming and design process and constantly trying the different colour for the whole week, I realised that it would have been an easy decision if I had focused on the people&#x2019;s problem, rather than making my design beautiful. Making the design right both in UI and UX is important but the single most concerning thing is how you gonna make it, &#xA0;by creating best-looking interfaces or by taking people&#x2019;s problems.</p><p>Not only is the responsibility of the UX designer or researcher to take the pain points and user problems but UI designer has also got to work on the problems of people while they use the interface. Because through a better UI, people are going to communicate with the product. And if it is broken, Nobody can understand your best solution.</p><h4 id="so-what-actually-people-care-about"><strong>So what actually people care about?</strong></h4><p>People have their problems, they want to talk with their family and friends, they want something to entertain them, they want to be independent, they want to access information, they want to build things, they want to solve their problems, they have a lot of tasks to do, they want to make their life simple.</p><p><strong>You know, there are so many products in the market but not everybody uses the same product, people buy a product that they think can help them solve their problems. They don&#x2019;t care about how it looks, rather what they care about is can they use this product without the help of any person? or can they use this product with their hands? or is this product safe for their children or family? or can this product help them solve their problems of life?</strong></p><p>When a user chooses your product for their problems, then they have a kind belief that the people who have designed the product have taken care of their problems. And when as a product designer or product architect, we miss the real problems of the people, then no matter what the best UI, motion design or animation we have applied, our product will always suck and will make it harder for the people to accept in their life.</p><p>It hardly matters for the people what the design of the product is, Of course for some period of time like for a month or a year can a product evoke emotions and delight people but after a period of time it makes no sense for them, and what really matters to them is whether the product is still solving their problems and making their life easier or not. And I am pretty sure that, after a period of time, people don&#x2019;t even remember your best designs.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*zE7UZzvP37mrLyZtccrxOw.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Why people don&apos;t even care about your&#xA0;design?" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Source&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></figcaption></figure><p>For business, Good design helps them sell more. But to be always in the house or in the hands of the people, it needs to be designed for them and their life.</p><blockquote>Nobody cares about your design, for businesses, its money and for people, their problems.</blockquote><p>But the larger problem is, some teams and young designers, focuses too much on the other side of the design, which is making the design cooler and trending that they skip the real problems of the people. Some teams are more focused on improving the UI and UX patterns of their system rather than solving the problems of the users through an interface or experiences.</p><p>Even, sometimes, we designers become so obsessed about our design that sometimes the critique hurts but, in reality, no one in the world would care about it either. Only the designers who would do the product design exercise of your product or some upper management stakeholder would love to care about the design of colour. Because ultimately, people want better solutions.</p><blockquote>Don&#x2019;t make ego-centric design, rather create the eco-centric design which is design for everyone.</blockquote><p>Designing a better UI or physical shape is important but whether it should be the primary important or the secondary important will be your decision. Sometimes, when we focus and take care of people problems and their pain points then the whole problems drive the design on both the UI and UX parts. But the other way round won&#x2019;t work too far.</p><p>You know when we do the A/B testing for designs, it really does not matter what colour users like rather what really matters is what contrast, tint or shade of colour makes users understand the functionality of the given button. So we need to change our focus from how it looks to how best it solves people&#x2019;s problems.</p><p>Some designers and teams think that a cooler interaction or some animation will help them giving some best designs to people, but what actually happens is something different. When you design some cool interactions or animations, and you show it to people and ask them how they feel about it then they would happily say that they are loving it but when you ask the same person after a month, you will most probably get a different answer. And then there would be no option for you to argue with users, either you would have the option to change it or remove it. So never ask users what they like or love, because over time, love can be something different and about likes, it depends on what the latest best thing people have seen.</p><p>You know there are good examples where it had been proved that good design is not always about aesthetics, rather it is about whether the design is solving people problems first, <a href="https://ahmedabad.craigslist.org/" rel="noopener"><strong>Craigslist</strong></a> website is just a simple design with links all over and it works great.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*aLo8ipuTJnDvkkdOEXlKVQ.png" class="kg-image" alt="Why people don&apos;t even care about your&#xA0;design?" loading="lazy"></figure><p>Another example, In the video below, Mr Tom Kelly explained how they find out the real problems with the toothbrush of the kids, he explained how they used the field research to find the real problems with the kids using toothbrushes. And how a simple design change changed the usage of the toothbrush all around the world and made the product useful for the kids.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XrpAveg7ZIg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4><p>These are some of the examples where we can say that whenever we are working on a product, we should always start with the problems of the people and why people should use this product. And problems should not be only experience-based, but they can be based on physical appearances or in digital product, a UI problem. But your goal as a designer should always be to solve the problems of people.</p><blockquote>Nobody cares when it is Good Design, Good Design is invisible&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;Dieter Ram</blockquote><p>So, nobody cares about your design. And really they should not be. Because that is not what they want. People want something better, something simple, something which can make their life easier.</p><p>So be a designer who understands the people and design for the people.</p><p>Let me know what you think of being a designer.</p><h4 id="thanks-for-reading-">Thanks for reading.</h4>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[3 things UI Designers can learn from the developers aroundÂ them.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Being an only UX/UI designer in a team of full of developers is hard because every day you have to struggle hard to keep everyone on the same page...]]></description><link>https://gosink.in/3-things-ui-designers-can-learn-from-the-developers-around-them/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">607c5ad13bb4ecbd6cf336df</guid><category><![CDATA[Design]]></category><category><![CDATA[Design thinking]]></category><category><![CDATA[Design Value]]></category><category><![CDATA[UI]]></category><category><![CDATA[UI Design]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Aman Gupta]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2019 17:22:10 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://gosink.in/content/images/2019/12/nik-macmillan-YXemfQiPR_E-unsplash.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://gosink.in/content/images/2019/12/nik-macmillan-YXemfQiPR_E-unsplash.jpg" alt="3 things UI Designers can learn from the developers around&#xA0;them."><p>Being an only UX/UI designer in a team of full of developers is hard because every day you have to struggle hard to keep everyone on the same page while handling and sharing deliverables like UI pages, icons, illustrations, design specs.</p><p>I was doing my work perfectly being a UI Designer, but still, I was struggling on the part of the collaboration and sharing design files and organising my design files as I was working back and forth with the developers.</p><p>I had too much on my plate, I was designing hundreds of screens, a lot of icons and some illustrations but collectively it was a mess. There was no structure, no proper specification in my design files. Sometimes, it took me more minutes to find a certain file whenever a developer or my product manager asked me for a file. So, while I was busy designing the UI aesthetically pleasing, on the other hand, I created a mess of hundreds of files that even I cannot understand and get through it.</p><p>The design system is one of the ways to design and organise the different components that will be used in the system but still I needed a system to better organise this design system.</p><p>So in the need of the help, I did some online research and along with it, I asked my developer friends about how they manage their files among a team of 20 developers and how they make it easy for themselves and their team to share files without going to every person&#x2019;s desk.</p><p>We, designers and developer, may work with different screens but the kind of work we do at the core is common, which is creating and organising files.</p><p>So, here I am sharing what they have shared with me, and things which can help UI designers and web designers to improve the quality of the work and organise them in a better way.</p><h3 id="1-file-structuring-versioning-">1.

Naming Conventions &amp; guidelines</h3><p>When you are done with structuring your files in a clear way, the next thing is how you are gonna find them, mostly by the names you have given to them.</p><p>This is the thing which all my developer&apos;s friends told me to learn as they believe naming is the only way to structure your code or mess your code and being a developer, it is their first principle to create their naming convention so that everyone could name the elements in a similar way, so that it will be easier for them to locate and find them.</p><p>So creating a naming convention for your design files or components is very important because it will help you and other fellow designers to find the required files in a simpler way.</p><p>Along with the naming convention, you need to define your guidelines about using the design files, however, sometimes this might be included in the design system, but sometimes when you don&#x2019;t have a design system, you can create a set of guidelines for your team members to know how to use the design components.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/organized-designer/"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">Staying organized as a designer</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">New Haircut&#x2019;s Head of Product Design on the habits that&#x2019;ll help you and your design team be more organized and collaborate better.</div><div class="kg-bookmark-metadata"><img class="kg-bookmark-icon" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/www-inside-design/static/img/icon-144.png" alt="3 things UI Designers can learn from the developers around&#xA0;them."><span class="kg-bookmark-publisher">Manav Khurana,</span></div></div><div class="kg-bookmark-thumbnail"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/www-inside-design/uploads/2018/05/organize-design-sq.jpg" alt="3 things UI Designers can learn from the developers around&#xA0;them."></div></a></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/naming-conventions/"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">Best practices for design system naming conventions | Inside Design Blog</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">Quit making developers crazy and learn the naming conventions that will save your design system.</div><div class="kg-bookmark-metadata"><img class="kg-bookmark-icon" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/www-inside-design/static/img/icon-144.png" alt="3 things UI Designers can learn from the developers around&#xA0;them."><span class="kg-bookmark-author">Inside Design Blog</span><span class="kg-bookmark-publisher">Shayna Hodkin</span></div></div><div class="kg-bookmark-thumbnail"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/www-inside-design/uploads/2019/08/namingconventionfacebook.jpg" alt="3 things UI Designers can learn from the developers around&#xA0;them."></div></a></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/artboard-naming-conventions/?utm_campaign=Weekly%20Digest&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=77393570&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_JJ97NM4vQogZv3m0ZvGO4XNVcWU6Bmrc5h6FK8DiHX2p_M9c6a-QLO1_eyeThv60_AIVMXNC8OIUAMBKWjuekSc8o8A&amp;_hsmi=77523182"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">How to choose an artboard naming convention | Inside Design Blog</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">Artboard naming should be a science.
